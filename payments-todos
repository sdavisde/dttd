# Payments

Just cash/checks before website
- mailed in, generally
- kept a receipt book so they can give receipts to people who are paying manually
- Detail each check (for example, if we get one for $600, we need to be able to refund if candidate can't come)
- There's some dynamic stuff at play, since sometimes people don't want money back (pay it forward)
- spreadsheets used to be the source of truth for candidates/team payments
